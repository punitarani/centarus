# I don't know if this will work

_"Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence."_
_- Helen Keller_

_"It is not enough to be optimistic. One must also be realistic."_
_- John F. Kennedy_

I understand that there are always risks and uncertainties when we embark on new endeavors, and that's why it's important to be prepared for the potential downsides.

While what I am trying to do may not solve all the world's problems, I believe it has the potential to make a meaningful net difference.
Even if it only addresses a small fraction of global issues, it can still play a crucial role in driving global technological progress.
I understand that some people may view the problems I am trying to solve as trivial, but I believe that every small step we take toward a better future is important.
By addressing even the most seemingly insignificant challenges, we can pave the way for bigger and more impactful solutions.

I believe that by keeping an open mind and a positive attitude, we can find opportunities for growth and success even in the face of challenges.
I know that by staying true to myself and doing the right thing, I can make a positive impact and achieve the best possible outcome.

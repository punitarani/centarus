# Background

## Open Source Software

### What is OSS

**Software whose source code is publicly available.**

- Anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code.
- Often developed and maintained by a community of developers.
- Open source software is often free to download and use.
- The license specifies the terms of usage and distribution.

### Why use OSS

- **Cost**: Often free to download and use. Modest cost if paid.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can view, understand, and trust the software.
- **Flexibility**: Can be modified to meet your needs.
- **Collaboration**: Easily collaborate and contribute with the community.
- **Innovation**: Openly develop, share ideas, drive innovation, and improve.
- **Quality**: Developed and maintained by a community of developers.
- **Security**: Reviewed and audited by the community for vulnerabilities.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible and adaptable to work with other systems.
- **Support**: Active community of developers to help with questions and issues.

### Limitations of OSS

- **Lack of support**: Only large projects have an active community of developers.
- **Lack of documentation**: Often poorly documented or not documented at all.
- **Compatibility**: May not always be compatible and easily adaptable to work with other systems.
- **Lack of uniformity**: Often developed and maintained by a community of individual developers.
- **Lack of quality**: Depends on the community of developers to establish quality standards.
- **Lack of security**: Vulnerabilities can be found and exploited by malicious actors.
- **Lack of innovation**: Lack of funding and resources to drive innovation.
- **Lack of authority**: No central guidance to drive the development of the software.
- **Fragmentation**: Forks and clones can be developed and maintained by different communities.
- **Legal issues**: Difficult to enforce the license terms and protect the intellectual property.

### Current state of OSS

- **Growing**: It is growing rapidly and is becoming widely adopted at a lot of large tech companies.
- **Adoption**: It is being adopted throughout a variety of industries from Cloud Computing to IoT.
- **Dominance**: It is becoming the dominant software development model over proprietary software.

### Problems with the current state of OSS

- **Lack of Coordination and Collaboration** among different OSS projects.
  - Results in fragmentation and duplication of effort.
- **Lack of Funding and Resources** to grow and maintain OSS projects.
  - Prevents a lot of OSS projects from reaching their full potential.
- **Lack of Business Model** to sustain OSS projects in the long term.
  - Limits the self-sustainability and growth of OSS projects.

#### Some more problems with the current state of OSS

- A lot of OSS projects are led by a single or a few core developers.
- OSS projects are often started as a hobby or a side project and remain that way.
- They do not have a well-defined roadmap or a clear vision for the future.
- Lack of incentives to attract and retain a community of developers.

#### Most important problem with the current state of OSS

Most OSS projects are **made for Developers, not for Users.**

### Summary

Some of the key pain points of the current state of OSS include:
- Lack of coordination and collaboration among different OSS projects
- Lack of funding and resources
- Lack of a business model to sustain OSS projects in the long term. 

Additionally, many OSS projects are led by a single or a few core developers, are started as a hobby or side project, and do not have a well-defined roadmap or clear vision for the future.
The most significant problem with the current state of OSS is that most projects are made for developers, not for users.

## Organization

### What is an Organization

**A group of people with a common purpose.**

- Defined structure with some chain of command for decision-making.
- Policies and culture to guide the behavior of the members.
- Financial and human resources to support the operations.
- Systems and processes to coordinate, manage and track activities.

#### What is a Corporation

A legal organization that is separate from its owners.

- Limited liability
- Ownership
- Management
- Continuous existence

### Why form an Organization

- **Purpose**: To achieve a common goal.
- **Structure**: To define the roles and responsibilities of the members.
- **Culture**: To guide the behavior of the members.
- **Resources**: To support the operations.
- **Systems**: To coordinate, manage and track activities.
- **Governance**: To ensure the organization is operating in accordance with its purpose.
- **Accountability**: To ensure the organization is accountable to its members and stakeholders.
- **Transparency**: To ensure the organization is transparent to its members and stakeholders.
- **Sustainability**: To ensure the organization is sustainable in the long term.

### Problems with Corporations (in general)

- **Degradation of mission over time**: Solve a problem -> Increase market share -> Increase profits and power.
- **Lack of transparency and accountability**: The inner workings of most organizations are not publicly available.
- ** Lack of continued innovation**: Most organizations fail to innovate and adapt in the long run.

#### The Double-Edged Sword: Investors

- They want to realize ROI ASAP.
- They fail to recognize value to the community.
- They divert resources away from the primary mission.

**Investors are necessary** for the growth of a company.
In fact, they are often the **primary source of funding** for most companies.
However, they are also a **significant source of problems** for most companies.

Investors in this context are not individuals who invest in a company.
They are the **venture capitalists** and **private equity firms**.

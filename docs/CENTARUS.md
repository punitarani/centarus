## Open Source Software

### What is OSS

**Software whose source code is publicly available.**

- Anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code.
- Often developed and maintained by a community of developers.
- Open source software is often free to download and use.
- The license specifies the terms of usage and distribution.

### Why use OSS

- **Cost**: Often free to download and use. Modest cost if paid.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can view, understand, and trust the software.
- **Flexibility**: Can be modified to meet your needs.
- **Collaboration**: Easily collaborate and contribute with the community.
- **Innovation**: Openly develop, share ideas, drive innovation, and improve.
- **Quality**: Developed and maintained by a community of developers.
- **Security**: Reviewed and audited by the community for vulnerabilities.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible and adaptable to work with other systems.
- **Support**: Active community of developers to help with questions and issues.

### Limitations of OSS

- **Lack of support**: Only large projects have an active community of developers.
- **Lack of documentation**: Often poorly documented or not documented at all.
- **Compatibility**: May not always be compatible and easily adaptable to work with other systems.
- **Lack of uniformity**: Often developed and maintained by a community of individual developers.
- **Lack of quality**: Depends on the community of developers to establish quality standards.
- **Lack of security**: Vulnerabilities can be found and exploited by malicious actors.
- **Lack of innovation**: Lack of funding and resources to drive innovation.
- **Lack of authority**: No central guidance to drive the development of the software.
- **Fragmentation**: Forks and clones can be developed and maintained by different communities.
- **Legal issues**: Difficult to enforce the license terms and protect the intellectual property.

### Current state of OSS

- **Growing**: It is growing rapidly and is becoming widely adopted at a lot of large tech companies.
- **Adoption**: It is being adopted throughout a variety of industries from Cloud Computing to IoT.
- **Dominance**: It is becoming the dominant software development model over proprietary software.

### Problems with the current state of OSS

- **Lack of Coordination and Collaboration** among different OSS projects.
  - Results in fragmentation and duplication of effort.
- **Lack of Funding and Resources** to grow and maintain OSS projects.
  - Prevents a lot of OSS projects from reaching their full potential.
- **Lack of Business Model** to sustain OSS projects in the long term.
  - Limits the self-sustainability and growth of OSS projects.

#### Some more problems with the current state of OSS

- A lot of OSS projects are led by a single or a few core developers.
- OSS projects are often started as a hobby or a side project and remain that way.
- They do not have a well-defined roadmap or a clear vision for the future.
- Lack of incentives to attract and retain a community of developers.

#### Most important problem with the current state of OSS

Most OSS projects are **made for Developers, not for Users.**
